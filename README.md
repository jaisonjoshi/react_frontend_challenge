### Sample Data Used

As this is a frontend demostration project, instead of using a database, i have used a sample set of JSON data. Sample data is saved in the userList.js file in the assets/data folder. Instead of fetching real time data, this sample data is initially imported and used throughout the session. The crud operations in this project will be effective only in that particular session. After a session is closed, the data will be deleted.
